# Corizo Data Science Apprenticeship

## Day 1
1. Data Science Introduction: It outlines data collection, cleaning, analysis, and deployment of models to extract insights.
2. Python Basics: Covers variables, arithmetic operations, strings, data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, boolean), and basic operations with these types.
3. Lists and Dictionary Operations: Details operations like indexing, slicing, appending, inserting, removing, and other manipulations with lists and dictionaries.
4. Conditional Statements, Loops, and Functions: Introduces conditional statements (if, Elif, else), loops (for, while), and functions, demonstrating their use in decision-making, iteration, and creating reusable code blocks.

## Day 2
1. NumPy Arrays: NumPy provides support for creating and manipulating multidimensional arrays, which are more efficient for numerical computations than Python lists.
2. Array Operations: With NumPy, you can perform element-wise operations, broadcasting, and matrix multiplication, which streamline mathematical calculations.
3. Pandas DataFrames: Pandas introduces DataFrames, a tabular data structure with labeled axes, which simplifies data manipulation and analysis.
4. Data Handling in Pandas: Pandas offers powerful tools for data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation, making it ideal for working with structured data.
